This script will be useful for users, who edit tex files with text not in
English language. With this script you will no longer need to change
system language when editing usual text and formulas. Internal vim
language (see keymap) will change automatically based on cursor position.

For example, if you set in your .vimrc or tex.vim file 

   let g:tex_Keymap = 'ru'

then in text zone your keymap will be 'ru', and if you start edit a
formula keymap will be changed to default automatically.

It is based on default tex sintax information and some regular expressions.

To disable script you can commentify the string

   let g:tex_Keymap = 'ru'

Use <C-J> to manually change keymap

Suggestions and improvements are appreciated.
