This script will be useful for users, who edit tex files with text not in
English language. With this script you will no longer need to change
system language when editing usual text and formulas. Internal vim
language (see keymap) will change automatically based on cursor position.
For example, if you set in your .vimrc or tex.vim file 
   let tex_Keymap = 'ru'
then in text zone your keymap will be 'ru', and if you start edit a
formula keymap will automatically change to 'en'.

It is based on default tex sintax information.

To disable script you can set in your config 
   let b:loaded_tex_AutoKeymap = 1

To improve performance of the script, install vim version 7.3 with patch
196 or later.

Suggestions and improvements are appreciated.
